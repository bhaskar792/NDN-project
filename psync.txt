a PSync Interest message from each consumer carries the consumer’s subscription information and 
previously received producer state, so that the producer has all the information needed to
 process the message without having to keep track of every consumer.


because producers do not maintain state about consumers, each consumer can synchronize with any 
producer among a group of producers that replicate the same data



efﬁcient data representations such as Bloom Filters (BF) [6] and ranges are used to encode
 consumers’ subscriptions so only one PSync Interest message is sent 
from each consumer, irrespective of the number of subscribed name preﬁxes. 



 The Sync Interest contains the consumer’s subscription list in its interest name (not payload) 
which is used by the producer to check for updates to the subscribed data.



PSync uses regular NDN interest and data messages for subscription and notiﬁcation. We call 
these messages Sync Interest and Sync Reply, whose names begin with a routable 
preﬁx to reach the producer(s) and a component for demultiplexing, e.g., /hroutable-preﬁxi/psync 


Each consumer sends Sync Interests to the producer in order to learn about newly produced 
data in their subscribed data streams. If any data stream in the consumer’s subscription list 
has new data items, the producer will generate a Sync Reply to the consumer containing a 
list of new data names in the subscribed data streams 

Upon receiving the Sync Reply, which contains a list of new data names, the consumer will 
further check whether the data namesindeedbelongtoitsownsubscriptionlist.Ifadataname is a 
false positive, which means the producer returned a data name to which the consumer has not 
subscribed, then the name is ignored by the consumer. Otherwise, the consumer sends an Interest
 to the producer to fetch the new data and the producer or an intermediate cache will return the
 data (Step 3 and 4 in Figure6).Ifnonewdatamatchingtheconsumer’ssubscription list has been
 produced when the Sync Interest is received, the Interest will be maintained by the producer
 separately from the PIT in the NDN forwarder. The producer will respond immediately if any
 subscribed data stream has new data before the Interest expires. When the interest expires, 
the consumer will send a new Sync Interest.
